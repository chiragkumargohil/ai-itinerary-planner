# AI Itinerary Planner

This is a Python Flask application that leverages **LangChain** and **Gemini AI** to create personalized travel itineraries. Users can input details such as their starting point, specific locations, trip type, number of days, travel companions, and other preferences, and the application generates an AI-driven travel itinerary.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Itinerary Generation**: Uses LangChain's prompt templates and Gemini AI to generate tailored travel plans based on user inputs.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Accepts user preferences like starting location, travel mode, trip type, budget, and special notes.
- **Flask Backend**: Simple and scalable API built with Flask.
